# Identifying-political-persuasion-on-Reddit
This repository contains the code for a computer assignment for Natural Language Computing course (CSC401/2511, Winter 2022, UofT)

The assignment includes working with a social media corpus (i.e., a collection of posts from Reddit),
Python programming, part-of-speech (PoS) tags, sentiment analysis, and machine learning with scikit-learn.
We split posts into sentences, tagged them with a PoS tagger, gathered some
feature information from each post, trained models, and used these to classify political persuasion.
